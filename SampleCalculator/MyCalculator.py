# Lets create a calculator class. 
# Our class will have methods to add, sutbract, multiply and divide
# All methods are going to have two parameters i.e a and b
# a and  are integers
# We will then create a separate class to test the functionality of our code
# Lets begin:

# Create class Calculator
class Calculator:
    
    # Create method to add two integers a and b
    def add_numbers(a, b):
        return a + b

    # Create method to find the difference etween two integers a and b
    def subtract_numbers(a, b):
        return a - b

    # Create method to multiply two integers a and b
    def multiply_numbers(a, b):
        return a * b

    # Create method to divide two integers a and b
    def divide_numbers(a, b):
        return a/b
